## 🎯 For Your Friend (Non-Technical User)

**Only read these files:**
1. `BEGINNER_GUIDE.md` - Complete instructions
2. `CONFIG_REFERENCE.md` - Settings help

**Only edit this file:**
1. `config.sh` - Change RAM, restart times, etc.

**Main commands to use:**
```bash
cd /root/scripts
./server-manager.sh status    # Check everything
./server-manager.sh restart   # Restart server
screen -r mcserver           # View server console
```

**Emergency stop:**
```bash
cd /root/scripts
./server-manager.sh stop
```

---

## 🔄 What Happens Automatically

1. **Container starts** → Runs `start-with-management.sh`
2. **Management starts** → Runs `server-manager.sh start`
3. **Four components start:**
   - Minecraft server (`mcserver` screen)
   - Auto-restart manager (`mcrestart` screen)
   - Performance monitor (`mcmonitor` screen)
   - Backup system (`mcbackup` screen)

**Your friend doesn't need to understand the technical details - the system "just works"!**

---

## 🚨 What NOT to Delete

**Keep these files:**
- `config.sh` - Settings
- `server-manager.sh` - Main control
- `server-controller.sh` - Server control
- `start-with-management.sh` - Auto-startup
- `BEGINNER_GUIDE.md` - Instructions

**Safe to delete if needed:**
- `monitor.sh` + `backup.sh` (removes monitoring/backup features)
- `mc-auto-restart.sh` (removes auto-restarts)
- Documentation files (but you'll lose instructions!)

---

This system is designed so your friend only needs to:
1. Read `BEGINNER_GUIDE.md`
2. Edit `config.sh` for their settings
3. Use `./server-manager.sh` commands for daily management

Everything else happens automatically! 🎉
